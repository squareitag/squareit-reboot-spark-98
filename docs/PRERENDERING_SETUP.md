# Pre-rendering Setup for SEO

## Overview
This project uses automated pre-rendering via GitHub Actions to generate SEO-friendly static HTML pages that search engines and tools like SEObility can properly crawl.

## How It Works

### Automated Pre-rendering
- **Trigger**: Runs automatically on every push to `main`/`master` branch
- **Process**: 
  1. Builds the React application
  2. Starts a preview server
  3. Uses Puppeteer to crawl all pages
  4. Generates static HTML files with embedded meta tags
  5. Commits the pre-rendered files back to the repository

### Generated Files
- **Location**: `prerendered/` directory
- **Content**: Static HTML files with proper meta tags
- **SEO Ready**: Fully crawlable by search engines and SEO tools

## Benefits for SEO

✅ **SEObility Compatible**: Meta tags are now embedded in static HTML  
✅ **Search Engine Friendly**: All pages are crawlable without JavaScript  
✅ **Faster Loading**: Pre-rendered pages load immediately  
✅ **Better Rankings**: Improved SEO performance  

## Monitoring Pre-rendering

### GitHub Actions
- Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
- Look for "Pre-render Pages for SEO" workflow runs
- Monitor for any failures or issues

### Pre-rendered Files
- Files are automatically committed to the `prerendered/` folder
- Each page gets its own HTML file with embedded meta tags
- Files update automatically when content changes

## SEObility Testing

After the first pre-rendering run:

1. **Wait** for the GitHub Action to complete
2. **Check** that files exist in the `prerendered/` directory
3. **Test** with SEObility using the pre-rendered HTML files
4. **Verify** that meta tags are now properly detected

## Manual Pre-rendering (Optional)

If you need to run pre-rendering locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
npm install puppeteer

# Build and run
npm run build
npm run preview &
node scripts/production-prerender.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Action Fails
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify Puppeteer installation
- Ensure preview server starts correctly

### Missing Meta Tags
- Verify React Helmet is working correctly
- Check that all pages render properly
- Ensure meta tags are set before pre-rendering

### SEObility Still Can't Read Tags
- Confirm pre-rendered files exist
- Check that HTML files contain embedded meta tags
- Verify SEObility is testing the right URLs

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor** the first GitHub Action run
2. **Verify** pre-rendered files are generated
3. **Test** with SEObility again
4. **Deploy** pre-rendered files to your hosting platform

The automated pre-rendering will solve your SEObility meta tag detection issues!
